<h2>History of Bengaluru</h2>
<p>
Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore, has a rich and vibrant
history that dates back to the 16th century. It was originally a
small settlement ruled by local chieftains. In the 17th century, it
came under the rule of the Mysore Kingdom, which transformed it into
a major center of trade and commerce.

In the 19th century, Bengaluru became a British military garrison
and eventually grew into a large city. It served as the capital of
the Mysore Princely State until India's independence in 1947. After
independence, Bengaluru emerged as a major industrial and
technological hub, earning it the nickname "Silicon Valley of India."
